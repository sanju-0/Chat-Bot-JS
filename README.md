# InteractIQ 
InteractIQ is an innovative project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a chatbot system. It has an advanced feature that makes user interactions easy by managing user queues efficiently.

One of the unique aspects of InteractIQ is that it has personalized responses created only through JavaScript, eliminating the need for external APIs. This approach provides prompt and customized responses that foster a deeper connection with users, enhancing their overall engagement and satisfaction.

InteractIQ aims to redefine the conventional chatbot experience through user-centric design and meticulous development. The platform is functional and remarkably personal and engaging, providing a chatbot experience that surpasses expectations.
